# PagerDuty Service Management Dashboard - Claude Code Implementation Guide

## Project Overview
Build a comprehensive PagerDuty service management dashboard that enables organizations to track service onboarding progress, manage team assignments, and enrich service data with ownership information. The goal is to achieve 100% completion of service data fields for better PagerDuty organization and management.

## Business Requirements from Management Discussion

### Core Objectives
1. **Service Onboarding Tracking**: Monitor the percentage of services that have been properly onboarded to PagerDuty
2. **Data Enrichment**: Populate missing fields like team names, ownership, and technical service associations
3. **Progress Monitoring**: Track completion percentages for critical fields to reach 100% data quality
4. **Ownership Confirmation**: Allow prime managers to select and confirm their services and associated technical services
5. **Automated Data Population**: Reduce manual input by leveraging existing PagerDuty data and Excel imports

### Key Features Required

#### 1. Summary Dashboard (Landing Page)
- **Progress Metrics Display**: Show percentage of onboarded services, services with defined team names, and confirmed services
- **Summary Excel Sheet View**: Display columns for:
  - CMDB ID
  - Service Name (service_name_mp)
  - Prime Manager
  - Prime Director
  - Prime VP
  - Team Name
  - API Name
  - Onboarding Status in PagerDuty
  - Completion Percentage
- **Filterable Columns**: Enable filtering by CMDB ID, service name, prime manager, prime director, prime VP, API name, and team name
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual completion tracking for each service and overall statistics

#### 2. Service Management Actions
- **Edit Service**: Redirect to dedicated service editor page (`/service-editor/[serviceName]`)
- **Team Assignment**: Allow selection of PagerDuty teams instead of manual entry
- **Ownership Updates**: Enable prime managers to update ownership and technical service configurations
- **Service Confirmation**: Process for users to confirm service ownership and team assignments

#### 3. Data Integration & APIs
- **PagerDuty API Integration**:
  - Fetch service data including service ID and owned team
  - Retrieve team information to populate dropdowns
  - Update service configurations and team assignments
  - Sync ownership and technical service associations
- **Excel File Processing**: Import and process Excel files containing service data
- **Automated Population**: Auto-populate team names and other fields based on existing PagerDuty data

#### 4. UI/UX Requirements
- **Apple-Style Design**: Clean, modern interface with glassmorphism effects, rounded corners, and subtle shadows
- **Responsive Layout**: Support for desktop and mobile viewing
- **Scroll on Load**: Implement automatic scrolling for large datasets
- **Progress Visualization**: Individual service progress cards separate from main data table
- **Enterprise-Grade Appearance**: Professional styling suitable for corporate environments

## Technical Implementation Details

### Current Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router and TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 with Apple-inspired design system
- **State Management**: React hooks with custom `useExcelData` hook
- **File Processing**: xlsx library for Excel file handling
- **API Integration**: Mock PagerDuty API endpoints (to be replaced with actual API calls)

### Key Components
1. **ServiceManagementDashboard** (`src/components/ServiceManagementDashboard.tsx`)
   - Main dashboard with data table, filters, and progress tracking
   - No inline editing - all edits through dedicated pages
   - Separate progress tracking container with individual service cards

2. **Service Editor** (`src/app/service-editor/[serviceName]/page.tsx`)
   - Dedicated page for editing individual services
   - PagerDuty team selection dropdown
   - Service information management
   - API integration for service updates

3. **Excel Data Hook** (`src/hooks/useExcelData.ts`)
   - Data loading from Excel files
   - CRUD operations for service data
   - Progress calculation and validation

### API Endpoints to Implement

#### PagerDuty Service API
```typescript
// GET /api/pagerduty/services/[serviceId]
// Fetch individual service data
{
  id: string;
  name: string;
  teams: PagerDutyTeam[];
  html_url: string;
  status: string;
}

// PUT /api/pagerduty/services/[serviceId]
// Update service configuration
{
  serviceId: string;
  teamId: string;
  ownerId?: string;
  // Additional fields as needed
}
```

#### PagerDuty Teams API
```typescript
// GET /api/pagerduty/teams
// Fetch available teams for selection
{
  teams: PagerDutyTeam[];
}

interface PagerDutyTeam {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  summary: string;
}
```

#### Service Management API
```typescript
// POST /api/services/confirm
// Confirm service ownership and team assignment
{
  serviceId: string;
  primeManager: string;
  teamId: string;
  confirmed: boolean;
}

// GET /api/services/progress
// Get overall progress metrics
{
  totalServices: number;
  onboardedServices: number;
  servicesWithTeams: number;
  confirmedServices: number;
  completionPercentage: number;
}
```

### Data Model
```typescript
interface ExcelServiceRow {
  id: string;
  service_name_mp: string;        // Primary service identifier
  service_path: string;
  cmdb_id: string;               // CMDB identifier
  api_name: string;              // API service name
  prime_manager: string;         // Primary manager
  prime_director: string;        // Director level
  prime_vp: string;             // VP level
  mse: string;
  dyna_service_name: string;
  next_hop_process_group: string;
  analysis_status: string;
  next_hop_service_code: string;
  enrichment_status: string;
  team_name: string;            // PagerDuty team assignment
  confirmed: string;            // Confirmation status

- **Layout**: Generous whitespace, card-based design, responsive grid

### User Experience
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show essential information first, details on demand
- **Clear Actions**: Obvious buttons and interactive elements
- **Feedback**: Loading states, success/error messages, progress indicators
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, sufficient color contrast

## Success Criteria
1. **Data Quality**: Achieve 100% completion of service data fields
